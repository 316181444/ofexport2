- "man" opt instead of "i" print comprehensive help - sub pages? same source as markdown help?
- Scan all the DB locations
- documentation

- Projects/Folders should be interleaved in their original order  (awkward - worth the cost?)
- Filters (available etc) - finish - test

> Issue: 
> if I search for completed items, I dont see completed tasks in incomplete
> projects since the incomplete project is eliminated before we see the tasks.
> 
> Could have separate availability options for projects, contexts, tasks but can I infer this?
> 
> ** maybe Im pruning too early in the availability filter?
> dont prevent inclusion???
