- Nice date notation

> due(today), completed(today) etc.

- Eliminate within()
- Overrides (-D) not passed to command line? do it in main?
- Eliminate "confusing" attributes from help? (blocked)
- Filter all (=true?)
- Project status should cascade FROM folders
- Improve model class hierachy

> Make Node an interface?
> ProjectModeNodeInterface
> has getProjectModeParent
> 
> eliminate/reduce dummy methods

- add due where due period in config
- do I need availability/remaining/completed on all the nodes? (no)

> Use the proper fields, active/status? as they appear in OF

- Update tests to cover new features
- Override config on command line
- Document config
- Command line config overrides - document with config doc

> -D x=y

- debug format missing estimatedMinutes
- Turn context status into 3 flags
- Write visitor that sets availability

> Is that better than each node doing it?
> 
> At least it centralises the logic

- Check examples
- Finish refactoring Project
- Copy annotations from task - boo.
- Sort out root task parantage

> Tasks should have one parent - either a project or task

- Availability depends on parent
- Bugs
  - May have to rethink "available" - ignore blocked?

  - Paused projects seem to be considered "available"

  - Empty single action lists appear in contexts when empty

  - Why traversing a node (folder) twice?
- Add -fo open
- Add dates to release date
- Add "Tips" to index
- upadate old ofexport, point to new
- Diagnostic format

> Could store results of expr evaluation on node and print

- of2 -ti 'available && !completed && (flagged || within(dueDate,"-1y","2d"))' -F -p

> inbox item appears twice
> 
> -F is the culprit

- fix fdone to include inbox
- Write due scripts - having issues?
- Project/context depth attribute
- Tell people...
- Release V1.0.4
- of2 -fn Home -ti 'completed'  -tx 'completed && completionDate<date("mon")' -ts completionDate -p

> why does this show my whishlist?

- of2 -fn Home -ti 'completed && completionDate >= date("mon")' -F -p -f report -o ~/Desktop/report.taskpaper

> The -F erases everything
> 
> swapping F and p fixes

- Bug: "of2  -pn X" get number format exception - why???

> Seems to be that x interpreted as char, but xx as String, as is xx

- Create a Weekly Report template
- Update my own ofexport scripts - delete old ones

- Add my usage to examples
- Flatten transformation - do in template? (breaks sorting)
- Tips
  - "tag" projects for inclusion in report
- check out released of2, make sure it's OK
- Bug: Tasks in Dropped Folders become visible in context mode
- due missing from taskpaper?
- displaying too much: of2 -c -ti available -p -ts r:flagged -ts dueDate
- Is prune working? - not on project root tasks in context mode
- Don't print help when no options - update doc
- Release process hasn't released correct jars from root directory
- Is this release process worth the pain? just do everything on master?
- Syntax is a bit cryptic can we have different options for include/exclude?
- include/exclude problem

> works: of2 -te 'name=="Documentation"' -te '-:completed'
> doesnt: of2 -te 'name=="+:Documentation"' -te '-:completed'

- Experiment with include/exclude
- Documentation
  - Proof Read
  - Check prune still works
  - Check examples
  - Update explanation of filters to mention include exclude.
- Code Quality 
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Add stats/summary after load (counts of projects, tasks etc)
- How to restructure (group knitting)
  - Transforms - create one to experiment
- Longer Term
  - Decode attributes on contexts
  - sort XML/json field output
