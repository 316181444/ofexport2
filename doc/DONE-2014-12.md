### ofexport2

- Bug: "of2  -pn X" get number format exception - why???

> Seems to be that x interpreted as char, but xx as String, as is xx

- Create a Weekly Report template
- check out released of2, make sure it's OK
- Bug: Tasks in Dropped Folders become visible in context mode
- due missing from taskpaper?
- displaying too much: of2 -c -ti available -p -ts r:flagged -ts dueDate
- Is prune working? - not on project root tasks in context mode
- Don't print help when no options - update doc
- Release process hasn't released correct jars from root directory
- Is this release process worth the pain? just do everything on master?
- Syntax is a bit cryptic can we have different options for include/exclude?
- include/exclude problem

> works: of2 -te 'name=="Documentation"' -te '-:completed'
> doesnt: of2 -te 'name=="+:Documentation"' -te '-:completed'

- Experiment with include/exclude
- Documentation
  - Proof Read
  - Check prune still works
  - Check examples
  - Update explanation of filters to mention include exclude.
  - Add "Examples"
  - Add "Writing a Template"
- Code Quality 
  - Do I really want to publish the site? big...
  - Coverage
  - maven site report
  - Address TODOs
  - Timing and stats

> > Have default or named configuration files
> > Use spring

  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Add stats/summary after load (counts of projects, tasks etc)
  - basic javadoc
  - Only integration tests should use real DB
  - format code
