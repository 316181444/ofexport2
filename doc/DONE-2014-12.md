- Bug: Tasks in Dropped Folders become visible in context mode
- due missing from taskpaper?
- displaying too much: of2 -c -ti available -p -ts r:flagged -ts dueDate
- Is prune working? - not on project root tasks in context mode
- Don't print help when no options - update doc
- Syntax is a bit cryptic can we have different options for include/exclude?
- include/exclude problem

> works: of2 -te 'name=="Documentation"' -te '-:completed'
> doesnt: of2 -te 'name=="+:Documentation"' -te '-:completed'

- Experiment with include/exclude
- Documentation
  - Proof Read
  - Check prune still works
  - Check examples
  - Update explanation of filters to mention include exclude.
  - Add "Examples"
  - Add "Writing a Template"
