- check out released of2, make sure it's OK
- Bug: Tasks in Dropped Folders become visible in context mode
- due missing from taskpaper?
- displaying too much: of2 -c -ti available -p -ts r:flagged -ts dueDate
- Is prune working? - not on project root tasks in context mode
- Don't print help when no options - update doc
- Release process hasn't released correct jars from root directory
- Is this release process worth the pain? just do everything on master?
- Syntax is a bit cryptic can we have different options for include/exclude?
