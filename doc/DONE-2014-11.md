### ofexport2

- Create "installer"
  - Copy in license, docs etc.- everything?
  - Create "release process" - versioning?
  - Freemarker to process README?
- Filters (available etc) - finish - test

> Issue: 
> if I search for completed items, I dont see completed tasks in incomplete
> projects since the incomplete project is eliminated before we see the tasks.
> 
> Could have separate availability options for projects, contexts, tasks but can I infer this?
> 
> ** maybe Im pruning too early in the availability filter?
> dont prevent inclusion???

- Code Quality 
  - Address TODOs
  - basic javadoc
  - Only integration tests should use real DB
  - format code
- Sorting
- Prune option, add expressions automatically
- Problem: -cn Home not showing me sub contexts

> Presumably because it continues to recurse and eliminates sub contexts
> This is probably an issue with folders too.
> 
> Could abort matching after an include hit - consequences?
> 
> Filtering tasks on !completed would abort on match and include sub completed tasks.
> 
> Is the strategy flawed?
> 
> Solution
> -c -ce 'name=="Home" || included'
> 
> qualifiers:
> - only
> - everythingUnder

- More Integration tests - would be better to create tasks programatically
  - Extract key functionality into new OFExport class - test that
- Do I need all the integration tests now?
- HTML notes - and verify in browser on real example (project & context mode)
- Check Markdown displays properly (including notes, project and context mode)
- How to select what fields to include (ognl exprs to nullify?) - bother? just fix template
- Make template name equal suffix so it can be inferred
- Markdown template
- Whitespace usage - can  avoid long lines? eatspace option? (make templates more readable)
- use visit/recurse: http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directive_visit.html (maybe)

> http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directive_visit.html

- HTML template (base on OPML)
- Scan all the DB locations
- Use spring
- Externalise configuration files to directory (not resource path)

> Have default or named configuration files
> Use spring

- Templates - use FreeMarker

- Test example template
- TaskPaper heavy/lite formats (notes)
- How to specify templates on the command line
- Allow log level setting from the command line
- OPML
- Design integration test framework to test main()
- Add Markdown format
- Generate todo & change log as part of build
- Text output formats should skip roots
- Projects/Folders should be interleaved in their original order  (awkward - worth the cost?)
- delete main test (replaced by integration tests)
- Write integration tests to test options

> nodes by name
> nodes by expression

- Export model for testing - save included items, use SQLite descriptors to identify fields
- Tests failing because contexts not empty - No Context
- Don't delete root tasks, context walk is flat
- Test No Context
- Test Inbox
- Prune: use "taskCount>0"
- Sort attrib help
- inbox tasks
- Fix SQLITE date bug
- Better date function tests, and tidy up - use node expressions
- More command line tests - get a feel for usage
- Trying eliminating Excluded nodes after each expression
- filterTasksDown on included filter eliminates task we're matching on (main test)
- Regular expressions
- Look at OGNL
- exclude node if it's not included? opt to include all below included
- Sort out getX vs isX in SQLITE loader
- Issue should projects appear in contexts - or their root tasks? - check what happens
- Load notes
- Test traverser
- Test nodes - esp add(xxx), should unlink from old parents too
- AbortTraversal exception to shortcut unnecessary traversal?
- Make -xa implicit
- Rethink filters

> Base classes for visitor/filter with efficient tailored methods, avoiding unnecessary looping.

> descriptor needs to come from visitor

- Test knitting
- Test paths
- cmdlinf filter of functions - phases
- Natural order of tasks/items
- Group doesn't lend itself to filtering

> Can I do without it - only have it to support grouping by date, another way?

- Filters - add means of just providing a boolean fn
- Need to re-invent filtering concepts, tree walks etc from before. include/exclude etc.
- Mode: project/context
- Filters - how to filter the root
- Write tests of knitting
- Load dates into tasks/projects
- Use visitor for text format
- load a folder and subsidiary projects/folders/tasks
- Add multi level filters to adapters (done folders, finish for other types)
- Add 4 separate filter types to command line and apply
- Build accessor (eg getAvailable) from java
- Write more tests of OSE - enrich the dummy class
- Add slash separation of nodes
- where parsing too restrictive - what about _or? - RETHINK EXPRESSIONS?
- Is notation good enough as is? try examples (alternate main)
- Ressurect use of availability
- More sensible command line order processing
- Unit Tests
- Streaming JSON IO? & parallel execution?
- Wow it's slow - load whole tree from javascript?

> Filter and walk in the adapters?

- Lose the cacheing?
- Make an executable program
- Implement visitor pattern
- Add sorting
- Add filter to inbox(...)
- Create README

> Project name: p=name
> Project expression: P=expr
> Context name: c=name
> Context expression: C=expr
> Task expression: T=expr
> Inbox: i
> Availability: avail=...
> Flagged: flagged=...
> Format: fmt=XML,JSON,SimpleTextList
> Structure: struct=byStart,byCompleted,byProject,byContext
