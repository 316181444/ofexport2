- Markdown template
- Whitespace usage - can  avoid long lines? eatspace option? (make templates more readable)
- use visit/recurse: http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directive_visit.html (maybe)
  http://freemarker.org/docs/ref_directive_visit.html
- Use spring
- Externalise configuration files to directory (not resource path)
  Have default or named configuration files
  Use spring
- Templates - use FreeMarker

- Test example template
- TaskPaper heavy/lite formats (notes)
- How to specify templates on the command line
- Allow log level setting from the command line
- OPML
- Design integration test framework to test main()
- Add Markdown format
- Generate todo & change log as part of build
- Text output formats should skip roots
- delete main test (replaced by integration tests)
- Write integration tests to test options
  nodes by name
  nodes by expression
- Export model for testing - save included items, use SQLite descriptors to identify fields
- Tests failing because contexts not empty - No Context
- Don't delete root tasks, context walk is flat
- Test No Context
- Test Inbox
- Prune: use "taskCount>0"
- Sort attrib help
- inbox tasks
- Fix SQLITE date bug
- Better date function tests, and tidy up - use node expressions
- More command line tests - get a feel for usage
- Trying eliminating Excluded nodes after each expression
- filterTasksDown on included filter eliminates task we're matching on (main test)
- Regular expressions
- Look at OGNL
- exclude node if it's not included? opt to include all below included
- Sort out getX vs isX in SQLITE loader
- Issue should projects appear in contexts - or their root tasks? - check what happens
- Load notes
- Test traverser
- Test nodes - esp add(xxx), should unlink from old parents too
- Make -xa implicit
- Rethink filters
  Base classes for visitor/filter with efficient tailored methods, avoiding unnecessary looping.
  
  descriptor needs to come from visitor
- Test knitting
- Test paths
- cmdlinf filter of functions - phases
- Natural order of tasks/items
- Group doesn't lend itself to filtering
  Can I do without it - only have it to support grouping by date, another way?
- Filters - add means of just providing a boolean fn
- Need to re-invent filtering concepts, tree walks etc from before. include/exclude etc.
- Mode: project/context
- Filters - how to filter the root
- Write tests of knitting
- Load dates into tasks/projects
- Use visitor for text format
- load a folder and subsidiary projects/folders/tasks
- Add multi level filters to adapters (done folders, finish for other types)
- Add 4 separate filter types to command line and apply
- Build accessor (eg getAvailable) from java
- Write more tests of OSE - enrich the dummy class
- Add slash separation of nodes
- where parsing too restrictive - what about _or? - RETHINK EXPRESSIONS?
- Is notation good enough as is? try examples (alternate main)
- Ressurect use of availability
- More sensible command line order processing
- Unit Tests
- Streaming JSON IO? & parallel execution?
- Wow it's slow - load whole tree from javascript?
  Filter and walk in the adapters?
- Lose the cacheing?
- Make an executable program
- Implement visitor pattern
- Add sorting
- Add filter to inbox(...)
- Create README
  Project name: p=name
  Project expression: P=expr
  Context name: c=name
  Context expression: C=expr
  Task expression: T=expr
  Inbox: i
  Availability: avail=...
  Flagged: flagged=...
  Format: fmt=XML,JSON,SimpleTextList
  Structure: struct=byStart,byCompleted,byProject,byContext
