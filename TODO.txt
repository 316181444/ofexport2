- OPML
- Timing and stats
  Have default or named configuration files
  Use spring
- Projects/Folders should be interleaved in their original order  (awkward - worth the cost?)
- Filters (available etc) - finish - test
  Issue: 
  if I search for completed items, I don’t see completed tasks in incomplete
  projects since the incomplete project is eliminated before we see the tasks.
  
  Could have separate availability options for projects, contexts, tasks but can I infer this?
  
  ** maybe I’m pruning too early in the availability filter?
  don’t prevent inclusion???
