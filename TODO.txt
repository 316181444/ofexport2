- More Integration tests - would be better to create tasks programatically
- How to select what fields to include (ognl exprs to nullify?)
- Check Markdown displays properly (including notes)
- HTML template (base on OPML)
- "man" opt instead of "i" print comprehensive help - sub pages? same source as markdown help?
- documentation
- Timing and stats
  Have default or named configuration files
  Use spring
- Projects/Folders should be interleaved in their original order  (awkward - worth the cost?)
- Filters (available etc) - finish - test
  Issue: 
  if I search for completed items, I don’t see completed tasks in incomplete
  projects since the incomplete project is eliminated before we see the tasks.
  
  Could have separate availability options for projects, contexts, tasks but can I infer this?
  
  ** maybe I’m pruning too early in the availability filter?
  don’t prevent inclusion???
- AbortTraversal exception to shortcut unnecessary traversal?
- Coverage
- Transforms - create one to experiment
- Look at OF1 for command line inspiration
- Address TODOs
- How to restructure (group knitting)
- load tasks with no context?
